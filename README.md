## Quick start

### Add to composer.json

```bash
composer require satariall/lightopenid
```

### Sign-on with OpenID in just 2 steps:
  
  1. Authentication with the provider:

     ```php
     $openid = new LightOpenID('my-host.example.org');
     
     $openid->identity = 'ID supplied by user';
     
     header('Location: ' . $openid->authUrl());
     ```
  2. Verification:

     ```php
     $openid = new LightOpenID('my-host.example.org');
     
     if ($openid->mode) {
       echo $openid->validate() ? 'Logged in.' : 'Failed!';
     }
     ```

### Support for AX and SREG extensions:
  
  To use the AX and SREG extensions, specify `$openid->required` and/or `$openid->optional` 
  before calling `$openid->authUrl()`. These are arrays, with values being AX schema paths 
  (the 'path' part of the URL). For example:

  ```php
  $openid->required = array('namePerson/friendly', 'contact/email');
  $openid->optional = array('namePerson/first');
  ```

  Note that if the server supports only SREG or OpenID 1.1, these are automaticaly mapped 
  to SREG names. To get the values use:

  ```php  
  $openid->getAttributes();
  ```

  For more information see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/Satariall/LightOpenID/blob/master/USAGE.md).
